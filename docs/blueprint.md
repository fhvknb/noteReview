## Original User Request:
I want to create a website using the Next.js framework that implements a note review feature. The notes should include the following content: note category, original note, and note summary. The notes should be displayed as a list of cards. Each card should show the content of the [note summary] field. Below each card, there should be a 'Show Original' button that toggles the display of the [original note] content. There's no need for a note addition feature, only display functionality is required. The note display should support filtering and pagination. The interface should be simple and visually appealing. The note data is obtained from an external database and includes note category, original note, and note summary. Please help me with the project initialization and the code for the main basic features based on these requirements.
